In this project, I developed a program for the Corner Grocer, designed to analyze and track the frequency of items purchased throughout the day. 
The primary problem it solved was helping the store manage and optimize their inventory and layout by understanding which items are purchased most frequently.

One thing I did particularly well was ensuring the code was clean, well-documented, and followed best practices, which made the program both
efficient and easy to maintain. However, I believe I could enhance my code further by refining the algorithm used to read and process the data, potentially making it more 
efficient and scalable for larger datasets.

The most challenging part of the project was implementing the histogram feature. I overcame this challenge by carefully structuring my code and 
using resources like online documentation and tutorials to refine my approach. I also sought feedback from peers, which helped me find a solution that was both functional and user-friendly.

From this project, I gained valuable skills in file handling, data analysis, and user input validation, all of which will be highly transferable to
future projects. I made the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by adhering to a consistent coding style, utilizing classes to encapsulate functionality, 
and adding thorough comments to explain each part of the code. This approach not only ensured that the program met the requirements but also that it could be easily
modified or extended in the future.
